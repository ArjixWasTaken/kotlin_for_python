Kotlin for Python Developers
============================

Kotlin: it's new, it's hot, it's exciting! If you're a Python developer,
you might be interested in Kotlin for Android development. If you're
a PyCharm user, you might want to write an IDE plugin, using Kotlin.

In both cases, you're looking to to add Kotlin to your programming arsenal.
This documentation teaches Kotlin -- from the perspective of a Python
developer who knows nothing about Kotlin, Java, Gradle, or the JVM.

To Do
=====


8) Kotlin does some magic behind-the-scenes creation of Java classes
   named from the file name, because Java needs classes

9) Comparison of “compilation” pipelines

10) Comment syntax

11) Variable definitions: var vs. val (immutable)

11a) …and compiler enforcement

12) Implications of typing when assigning/re-assigning

12a) …and compiler enforcement, vs. Python

13) Explicitly defining a type during declaration: the same

14) Re-assignin immutable via val causes compiler error

15) Calling functions and type checking
