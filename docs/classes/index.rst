Classes
=======


1) Defining a class with a method but no constructor, P has “self”

2) Creating instance of class does NOT require new in either

3) Class variables access in P via self or class name

4) P can assign instance attributes whenever it wants (within __ limitations), change types whenever, no concept of public/private

5) Constructors

6) Binding of constructor arguments to instance attributes (assignment, usage)

    ? - What happens if I don’t do var in the constructor? It’s unresolved later, but where does it go?
