About This Guide
================

In no time at all, Kotlin has become an important language to learn,
with videos and tutorials and examples and...everything you could
want.

Unless you're a Python dev. Kotlin is "better Java", but most
resources presume you know Java and its ecosystem. It sure would be
nice if this shiny new toy was explained in Python terms.

That's what we're doing in this guide. Assuming you know nothing about
Java, Gradle, etc., we're going to get you productive in Kotlin and
IntelliJ. If you're not a Python developer, you will likely still
find this guide useful.
