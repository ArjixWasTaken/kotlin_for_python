===================
Variables and Types
===================

JavaScript ES6 and TypeScript do (``let`` and ``const``.)


As we'll see
later, Kotlin lets you skip the syntax by inferring type information,
but it is still at compile time.

Kotlin will let you know to use a val when you use a var unnecessarily

- Inferred types versus explicit

- The compiler will fail on re-assignment of val

- Scope: top-level versus local

Class variables: properties and fields covered in classes

- Types on variables

- Basic types https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-types.html#basic-types
